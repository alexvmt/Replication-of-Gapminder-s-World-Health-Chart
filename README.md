# Replication of the Gapminder World Health Chart

In this project I replicate the Gapminder World Health Chart using Shiny and Google Charts. The original chart can be found on Gapminder.org and in the book "Factfulness" by Hans Rosling.

A live version of the Shiny app is available [here](https://alexandermerdiantarko.shinyapps.io/replication-of-the-gapminder-world-health-chart/).
